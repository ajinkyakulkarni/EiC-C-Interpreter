Hi Ed,

Today I downloaded EiC, and I must say, I really don't regret it!
Great stuff!

I ran into a little problem however, when I tried to use fscanf,
in (for example):
			
  	  	
FILE * f = fopen("somefile", "r"); 
        /* Just a file with some lines of text, separated by newlines */
        /* Perhaps this e-mail will do ;-) */
char buf[256];

while (fscanf(f,"%[^\n]\n",buf) != EOF) printf("%s\n", buf);

        /* If you try this at home, I suggest you use : */

int j = 1, maxj = 100; 
        /* or some convenient number for maxj */

while ((fscanf(f,"%[^\n]\n",buf) != EOF) && (j < maxj))\
printf("Line %i: %s\n", j++, buf);

There were two problems:
  1: fscanf never gets past the first newline.
  2: later on, (after I fixed 1), I found EOF is never detected.

I took the liberty of hacking around in _eicUscanf (in stdio.c)
until it worked, and hereby send you the result. 
This version is also allows one to use ranges in scansets.
I hope you can use it, and that it doesnot break anything.
(I attached the improved (?) version of _eicUscanf and also
 a diff of the new(<) and the old (>) stdio.c)

Oh, by the way, the makefile for seic (Makefile.seic) misses two
objects, reset.o and callback.o, IIRC.
